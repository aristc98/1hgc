# Webpage Accessibility 

## Description
For this project, I am helping a client make their website more accessible by cleaning up their code and adding attributes. All over the world, users with disabilities rely on elements to describe images or certain information. This can be done by adding alt attributes and figure captions. This also makes the webpage more accessible for search engines, which means more exposure for your webpage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

When navigating the webpage, you will be able to inspect the elements and see alt attributes. You can inspect the elements with the command "Control+shift+I" for windows or "command+option+I" for Mac OS.
